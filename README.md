# Water-Potability

I used water potability dataset (kaggle.com/code/dhruba60601/water-potability-drinking/data) to make a model for predict it's potability. This dataset contains some of organic,inorganic or compounds of water. Base of these the model is created according to i'ts necessity.


and I got accuracy 66%. I have used Boosting technique for model building(Gradient Boost and XGBoost). I also used Random forest. At that time I got accuracy 67%. And when I used KNN, I got 66% accuracy. I have also used another algorithms,but they give only 62-63% accuracy. So I come to know that these 3 algorithms gives us better result, if we used scalling. Otherwise we'll get the low accuracy.
